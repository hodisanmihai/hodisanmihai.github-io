            Hi, I’m <span style="color:#00674f;">HODISAN MIHAI</span>, a 20-year-old web developer based in <span style="color:#00674f;">Oradea, Romania</span>. I have always embraced my creative side, and over time, I've cultivated a logical mindset that complements my passion for design and technology. My journey into web development began as a hobby, where I explored the art of creating beautiful, functional websites. This curiosity transformed into a full-fledged career path as I discovered the joy of bringing ideas to life through code.
           My desire to be heard and understood drives me to create meaningful work that resonates with others. I believe that every project tells a story, and it’s my goal to craft narratives that engage users and provide real value. I admire individuals who have the power to change the world and possess a deep understanding of our surroundings. These qualities inspire me to blend creativity with technical skills, ensuring that my projects are not only visually appealing but also intuitive and user-friendly.
           In addition to my technical skills, I continuously seek to learn and grow. I enjoy staying updated on industry trends and emerging technologies, which helps me adapt my approach and incorporate new ideas into my work. Whether it's diving into a new programming language, experimenting with design tools, or collaborating with fellow developers, I relish every opportunity to expand my knowledge and skill set.
           As I look to the future, I aim to contribute to projects that make a positive impact on people's lives. I’m particularly passionate about creating accessible web experiences that empower users, regardless of their background or abilities. My dream is to work on projects that not only showcase my technical abilities but also embody my values of inclusivity and innovation.
           Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. I’m excited to connect, collaborate, and create something remarkable together!

            My first contact with web development was back in 2020 when I wrote a small paragraph in Notepad. To be honest, I didn’t like it. A few months later, I gave it another try, but once again, it didn’t click for me. It wasn’t until the summer of 2023 that everything changed—I woke up one day, opened my laptop, and decided to dive back into web development, almost as if it came from nowhere.
            I started with a course on Codecademy, and that’s when my passion truly began to grow. As I progressed, I became fascinated by the world of <span style="color: #00674f;">Web Development</span>, <span style="color: #00674f;">Design</span>, and <span style="color: #00674f;">UI/UX</span>. What began as a simple curiosity soon turned into a deep desire to learn, explore, and create.
            Since then, I’ve developed a passion for building websites that are not just functional, but also aesthetically pleasing and user-centered. The process of combining creativity with problem-solving is something I find incredibly fulfilling, and it drives me to continuously push my limits as a developer. Now, I’m committed to discovering new technologies, enhancing my skills, and developing amazing websites that leave a lasting impression.

            <div class="contenttext"> I’ve never been one to enjoy learning purely from an academic perspective. The idea of studying things that didn’t genuinely interest me never appealed to me. In high school, I pursued an economic specialization that didn’t align with my true passions. After graduating, I enrolled in college to study <span style="color: #00674f;">Mechanical Engineering</span>, which had always fascinated me. However, I soon realized that I didn’t want to build a career in that field.
            While still on this path, I had the chance to observe a <span style="color: #00674f;">Full Stack Developer</span> writing code, and I was captivated! This experience sparked my curiosity, leading me to explore programming and the various paths it offered. After that summer when I started learning to code, I enrolled in a boot camp called <span style="color: #00674f;">Fastrack-IT</span>, where I immersed myself in <span style="color: #00674f;">Full Stack Development</span> for seven months.
            After the summer of 2023, I made the decision to drop out of my first college. This choice allowed me to fully dedicate myself to learning and developing new skills. I am now in my first year at <span style="color: #00674f;">I.E.T.I. (Oradea)</span>, excited about the journey ahead in the tech industry.</div>

    As I look to the future, I have several key goals that drive my ambition. First, I am committed to <span style="color: #00674f;">deepening my knowledge in web development</span>, staying updated with new technologies to create impactful digital solutions. 
       Additionally, I recently launched my clothing brand, <span style="color: #00674f;">LostMemory</span>, which I aim to develop into a unique brand that inspires individuality. 
    I’m also exploring <span style="color: #00674f;">day trading</span> to enhance my financial literacy and gain insights into investment strategies. Achieving mastery in what I call my <span style="color: #00674f;">"knowledge pillars"</span> is vital, including <span style="color: #00674f;">Financial Knowledge</span> (mastering money management and investments), <span style="color: #00674f;">Freedom Knowledge</span> (understanding independence and personal choices), <span style="color: #00674f;">Socialization Knowledge</span> (building meaningful relationships), and <span style="color: #00674f;">Health Knowledge</span> (prioritizing well-being and a healthy lifestyle).
     I also aim to <span style="color: #00674f;">enhance my sales skills</span> to effectively communicate my ideas and products. Ultimately, I want to <span style="color: #00674f;">inspire others</span> who may not have had the same opportunities as me, showing them that they can achieve their dreams and unlock their potential.
